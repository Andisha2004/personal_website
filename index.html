                    <hr>


                    <p class="lead">As an ambitious and determined computer science major
                        hailing from Afghanistan, I bring a unique perspective and unwavering
                        commitment to my pursuit of a career in the tech industry.
                        My journey from a region with limited educational opportunities
                        and the challenges I've faced, particularly in the wake of the
                        Taliban takeover, have only strengthened my resolve.
                        I've been fortunate to have a family that supports and encourages
                        my educational pursuits, allowing me to explore my passion for technology.
                        Currently, I'm a dedicated student at Cornell University,
                        where I've embraced opportunities to learn about cutting-edge tech
                        and its potential for positive change. With a keen interest in computer science
                        and a minor in business, I aspire to contribute to the tech world's innovation
                        while leveraging my entrepreneurial spirit to create a lasting impact.
                        I am excited about the prospect of collaborating with tech companies and making
                        meaningful contributions to their endeavors.</p>

                        or developing diverse software solutions. My expertise
                        in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) allows me to design
                        and implement robust, scalable systems efficiently. With
                        a solid grasp of web technologies like HTML, CSS, and
                        JavaScript, I can create engaging and interactive web
                        experiences. Furthermore, my proficiency in Git and GitHub
                        ensures that I maintain effective version control and
                        collaborative coding practices. Utilizing various development
                        environments such as VS Code, Eclipse, Atom, and IntelliJ IDEA,
                        I am equipped to handle a wide range of projects with efficiency
                        and precision.</p>

                                <h2>Camp Mosaic Counselor (August 2023)</h2>


                                <p>My experience as a camp counselor at Camp Mosaic
                                    in Edison, NJ, during August 2023 was a
                                    profoundly rewarding opportunity.
                                    In this role, I volunteered my time and energy
                                    to guide and support children aged 6-13 throughout
                                    their camp experience. One of the most impactful
                                    aspects of this role was my involvement in creating
                                    a more inclusive and respectful environment within
                                    the camp. Together with my fellow counselors,
                                    we devised and implemented an innovative
                                    approach known as the "strikes" method.
                                    This method served as a proactive strategy
                                    to address instances of bullying, fostering a
                                    culture of empathy, cooperation, and mutual respect among
                                    the campers. By employing this method,
                                    we aimed to create a safe and harmonious
                                    atmosphere where every child felt valued and included.
                                    As a camp counselor, I had the privilege of not only
                                    organizing engaging activities but also serving as a positive
                                    role model and mentor to the campers. This experience not only allowed me to develop
                                    my leadership skills but also deepened my understanding of the importance of
                                    fostering a nurturing and inclusive environment for young individuals. My time as a
                                    camp counselor at Camp Mosaic underscored the significance of effective
                                    communication, teamwork, and empathy in building a supportive community. It was a
                                    heartwarming experience to witness the positive impact our efforts had on the
                                    campers, as they blossomed into more confident, respectful, and harmonious
                                    individuals. This experience reinforced my commitment to making a positive
                                    difference in the lives of others, a value that I carry with me in both my personal
                                    and professional endeavors.</p>

                                <h2>CSMore program (July 2023)</h2>


                                <p>I am proud to have successfully completed the competitive CSMore Program, an
                                    initiative that holds a special place in my journey towards becoming a computer
                                    scientist. This program not only equipped me with valuable technical skills and
                                    insights but also allowed me to actively contribute to the cause of diversity and
                                    inclusion in the tech industry—a mission close to my heart. The CSMore Program was a
                                    transformative experience, aiming to empower underrepresented students in computer
                                    science. Through a combination of mentorship, workshops, and dedicated resources, I
                                    was immersed in a supportive and enriching environment that encouraged academic and
                                    professional growth. This aligns seamlessly with my unwavering commitment to
                                    promoting equitable opportunities in the tech field, ensuring that talent and
                                    potential are recognized regardless of one's background. As part of this program, I
                                    had the privilege of delving into three essential courses: Pre-2800 Discrete
                                    Structure, Pre-3110 Data Structure, and Pre-3410 Computer System Organization and
                                    Programming. These courses laid a rock-solid foundation in computer science,
                                    providing me with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in this dynamic field.
                                    Additionally, I engaged in cutting-edge research and critical thinking exercises
                                    that expanded my horizons and fostered a deep appreciation for innovation and
                                    problem-solving. Beyond the classroom, I actively participated in on-campus
                                    activities and off-campus events, further enriching my academic journey. This
                                    program not only honed my technical capabilities but also cultivated my sense of
                                    community, reinforcing the importance of collaboration and mutual support in
                                    achieving success in the tech world. The CSMore Program was not just an educational
                                    experience; it was a transformative journey that empowered me to realize my
                                    potential as a computer scientist while actively contributing to creating a more
                                    diverse and inclusive tech industry. It reinforced my belief that diversity is the
                                    cornerstone of innovation, and I am determined to continue advocating for equitable
                                    opportunities in the field.</p>
